  ATHATH:
  - rscadd: Adds a variant of the external organ manipulation surgery for robotic
      body parts, similar to the robotic version of the internal organ manipulation
      surgery. It uses the same procedure as non-head/torso prosthetic organ manipulation.
  - rscadd: In layman's terms, augged people can get frills, antennae, wings, tails,
      etc. attached to them now.
  - qol: The suitability of crowbars in the "manipulate organs" and "manipulate features"
      steps has been boosted from 55% to 100%, but only for the robotic versions of
      those steps. Their suitability remains 55% for organic organ manipulation.

  - qol: Sivlerscale Tongue action is now a cooldown action, making it significantly
      easier to use
  - balance: Buffed the silverscale statue every so slightly, it now has innate armor
      and can reflect lasers shot at it. But it also requires you not by lying down
      to activate.
  - bugfix: Fix a runtime involving Bilingual Curators
  - qol: Bilinguals get a message on spawn reporting which language they've learned,
      or a message reporting they have learned no language if they're already fluent
      in all possible ones.

  - bugfix: Names for Interdyne pirates are now less bizzare
  - rscadd: Food and pills have a 10% chance to infect with one of three new diseases
      on consumption when left for more than 5 seconds on the floor. You can wash
      it to avoid disease. ChemMaster and Pill Press are added to the list of elevated
      structures (Considered as tables for pills). Made harvest spawn on top of hydrotrays
      to stay protected from germs.
  - rscadd: 'Added three new advanced diseases: Gastritium, Carpellosis, Nebula Nausea
      with static cures obtained by digesting dirty food.'

      injector.

  - bugfix: Arm implants properly handle EMPs depending on whether it is robotic or
      organic. No longer can you EMP an organic organ!

      a balloon alert
  - rscadd: 'Expanded the Experimental MODsuit Bepis node with three new modules:

  Tattle:

      crew members should still take more than a few hits to down but shouldn't be
      immune to it.

      of dumping it on the floor.
